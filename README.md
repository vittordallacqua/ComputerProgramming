# Computer Programming Class

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-C-blue)

A collection of C programming exercises developed during the *Computer Programming* course (course code: 1929877). The repository focuses on fundamental programming concepts, including recursion, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, file handling, sorting, and searching.

## Directory Structure

*Note: The actual file names may vary. Please refer to the repository for the exact file names and contents.*

## Key Topics Covered

- **Arrays:**  
  Exercises involving array manipulation, searching, and basic operations.

- **Pointers:**  
  Understanding pointer arithmetic, referencing, and dereferencing.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**  
  Utilizing `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` for memory management.

- **File Handling:**  
  Reading from and writing to files using standard C file I/O functions.

- **Recursion:**  
  Implementing recursive solutions for problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, etc.

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  Implementations of common sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

## How to Compile and Run

### Compilation

Navigate to the directory containing the C file you wish to compile and run:

```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
```

```Replace program_name with your desired executable name and source_file.c with the name of the C source file.```

### Execution

Run the compiled program using:

```bash
./program_name
```

```Note: On Windows, use program_name.exe instead of ./program_name.```
