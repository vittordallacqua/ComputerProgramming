## üß™ How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

### Compilation

Navigate to the directory containing the C file you wish to compile and run:

```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
```

```Replace program_name with your desired executable name and source_file.c with the name of the C source file.```

### Execution

Run the compiled program using:

```bash
./program_name
```

```Note: On Windows, use program_name.exe instead of ./program_name.```
